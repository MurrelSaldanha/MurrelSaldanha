- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MurrelSaldanha
- Iâ€™m interested in using ML algorithms in boosting biological data interpretability. Using online databases I want to discover better molecular targets and drug leads that can hasten the tedious process therapeutic development while keeping in mind factors like rising resistance. I believe this collaboration is critical in developing robust, precise and safer therapeutics.
- Iâ€™m  use clustering, classification and regression models on real world data. I am working on learning how to apply more advanced algorithms and develop neural networks for analysis of images generated during wet laboratory work.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects that are working on similar goals/require similar skills.
- Please feel free to reach me on murrel99@gmail.com
