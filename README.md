- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MurrelSaldanha
- Iâ€™m interested in using ML algorithms in boosting biological data interpretability. I believe this collaboration is critical in developing robust, precise and safer therapeutics
  as well as produce strategies in combating rising drug resistance.
- Iâ€™m  use clustering, classification and regression models on real world data. I am working on learning how to apply more advanced algorithms and develop neural networks for image analysis.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects that require above mentioned skills.
- Please feel free to reach me on murrel99@gmail.com
