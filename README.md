- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MurrelSaldanha
- Iâ€™m interested in using ML algorithms and its application in interpreting and analysing biological data. This includes, but it not limimited to discovering better molecular targets and drug leads that can hasten the tedious process involved therapeutic development, espesially with rising antibiotic resistance. I believe there is an increasing need in developing robust, precise and safer therapeutics, and this process can be bolstered with reliable ML drug discovery tools.
- I  use clustering, classification and regression models on real world data. I am working on learning how to apply more advanced algorithms and develop neural networks for analysis of images generated from the feild and patient samples.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects that are working on similar goals/require similar skills.
- Please feel free to reach me on murrel99@gmail.com
